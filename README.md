# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction

## Description

A data analysis project to understand the trends and major factors contributing to the worsening of AQI. Developed a Machine Learning model (linear regression) to predict the AQI value based on the values of major contributors like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, etc. Also includes a Random Forest classifier model which can classify AQI values as good, moderate and poor with an accuracy of 99
## Getting Started
